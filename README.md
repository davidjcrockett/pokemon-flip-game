<h1 align="center"> Pokémon Memory Game </h1>

A Pokémon-themed memory game built with React. This project's goal is to gain a better understanding of React while gaining more experience with useState and useEffect Hooks. Pokémon is owned by the Nintendo company and this project was built in mind for personal, non-commercial use.
